# Nedelec Edge Elements Methods for Maxwell's Equation

This repository contains an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) re-implementation of Nedelec Edge Elements Methods for Maxwell's Equations in MATLAB, originally featured in the book:

> _Li, J. and Huang, Y., 2012. Time-domain finite element methods for Maxwell's equations in metamaterials (Vol. 43). Springer Science & Business Media._

## Key Features

- **OOP Re-implementation:** A structured approach with an object-oriented design for better maintainability and usability.

- **Versatile Element Support:** Both rectangular and triangular elements have been implemented, expanding the application scope of the code.

## Included MATLAB Codes

This repository contains MATLAB codes for numerical electromagnetic fields. 

1. `@EdgeEle_linear_Tri` is a class for triangle elements, driven by `drive_EdgeEle_linear_Tri.m`.
   
2. `@EdgeEle_linear` is a class for rectangle elements, driven by `drive_EdgeEle_linear.m`.
   
3. `PlotGrid.m` is a utility script to plot rectangle grid in MATLAB.
